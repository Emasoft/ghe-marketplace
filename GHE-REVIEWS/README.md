# GHE Review Reports

This directory contains review reports generated by the REVIEW phase.

## Format

Each review is saved as `issue-{N}-review.md` and contains:
- Verdict (PASS/FAIL)
- Requirements checklist
- Code quality assessment
- Test results
- Reviewer notes
- Approval status

## Workflow

1. Review created in feature branch BEFORE merge
2. Committed to `issue-{N}` branch
3. Merges WITH approved code
4. If rejected, stays in rejected branch

Reviews are documentation of the quality process.
