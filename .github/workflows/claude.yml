# GitHub Claude Action Configuration for GitHub Elements Plugin
# Enables Claude Code AI assistance on issues and pull requests
#
# Interactive Mode: Respond to @claude mentions in issues/PRs
# Automation Mode: Can be extended with custom prompts for CI/CD automation
#
# Documentation: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code/github-actions
#
# SECURITY NOTE: This workflow does not use any run: commands with untrusted
# input interpolation. All user inputs are handled safely by the Claude action.
