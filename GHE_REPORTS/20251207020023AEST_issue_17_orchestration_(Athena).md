## Orchestration Decision

### Recommended Actions

**Issue #17 is a SESSION issue in CONVERSATION phase.** This is not a development issue requiring DEV/TEST/REVIEW workflow.

Session issues are used for:
- Capturing development session transcripts
- Tracking completed work items
- Maintaining discussion threads

**No agent spawning required** because:

1. **Not a development issue**: Session issues don't follow DEV->TEST->REVIEW workflow
2. **CONVERSATION phase**: No active development work to delegate
3. **Work items mostly complete**: 7/9 items done, remaining are verification tasks
4. **Related feature issue exists**: #18 handles the transcription feature work

### Remaining Tasks

The two pending items require **manual verification**:

1. **Test background agents skill**
   - Invoke background-agents skill manually
   - Verify Terminal window spawning works
   - Check reports appear in GHE_REPORTS/

2. **Verify transcription working**
   - Post a test message to issue #17
   - Confirm it appears in thread
   - Check hooks fire correctly

## Conclusion

**Issue #17 does not require agent orchestration.**

This is a session transcript issue in CONVERSATION phase. The 7 completed work items represent actual enhancements made during the session. The 2 pending items are verification tasks that require interactive testing.

**Recommendations:**
1. Test background agents skill interactively
2. Verify transcription hooks are firing
3. Consider closing this session issue once verification complete
4. Continue feature work in issue #18 (Transcription System Overhaul)
