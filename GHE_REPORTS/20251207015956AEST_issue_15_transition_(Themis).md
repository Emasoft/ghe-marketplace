  - `phase:review`

---

## Violations Detected

### V1: Issue Already Closed
The issue was closed on 2025-12-05. Phase transitions are only valid for OPEN issues.

### V2: Multiple Phase Labels
Issue has both `phase:dev` and `phase:review` labels. According to GHE workflow rules, an issue should only have ONE phase label at any time.

### V3: Backward Transition Attempt
Even if the issue were open, transitioning from REVIEW back to DEV/TEST is not allowed. The valid progression is:
```
DEV -> TEST -> REVIEW -> MERGE (only forward)
```

---

## Verdict

**TRANSITION DENIED**

The requested DEV->TEST transition for issue #15 is invalid because:
1. The issue is already CLOSED
2. The issue has conflicting phase labels (both DEV and REVIEW)
3. The issue has already progressed past TEST to REVIEW

---

## Recommendation

No action required. Issue #15 was successfully completed and closed on 2025-12-05. All acceptance criteria were verified as complete.

If a new transition request is needed, a new issue should be created.
