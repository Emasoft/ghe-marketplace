## Closing Comment

> "Approved by user. All acceptance criteria verified and tested. Transcription system redesign complete with phase-based thread management."

## Recommendation

No DEV work required - issue was already completed and closed before this agent was spawned. This appears to be a duplicate spawn request for an already-resolved issue.
