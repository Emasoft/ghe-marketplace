            Create a REVIEW issue for PR #$PR_NUMBER (for Hera agent).

            Steps:
            1. Get PR info: gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json title,body,files,author
            2. Create issue with title: [REVIEW] <pr-title>
               - Do NOT include phase labels in title (they're in labels)
            3. Labels: phase:review, source:pr, ready (add bot-pr if $IS_BOT_PR is true)
            4. Body: PR link, author, summary of changes, file list, review checklist
            5. Comment on PR linking to the new issue
            6. IMPORTANT: After creating the issue, update its title to include the issue number:
               - Get the created issue number from the output
               - Update title to: [ISSUE_NUM][REVIEW] <pr-title>
               - Example: [42][REVIEW] Add user authentication
